//how to pass method reference in child comp and use it in parent
//passing props to child and passing back to parent

//Rendering content dynamically (use a switch to show the content
//what happens when react rrnder the functional comp)
//handle content dynamically the javasrcipt way with variable assigment with jsx code map the state

//outputting arrays of data in lists...... interact with them...updating them...
//manipulate the array with clicklistener delete pizza from array
// flawed way:store the state in a var..call splice to  remove and set state
//mutated original data if working with state

//updating state immuatbly
//copy the aa\rray conts person = state.slice() then splice the copied array
//alt: const person = [...state]
